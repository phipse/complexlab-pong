Purpose:
  These are a bunch of files I wrote during the complex lab at the operating
  systems chair at Dresden University of Technology. 
  The goal of the complex lab is to write memory management, graphical
  output and keyboard input, providing the missing parts to get a simple pong
  game running on L4 (TuD).
